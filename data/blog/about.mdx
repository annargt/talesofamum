Hey there! Thanks for stopping by.
Here is a little bit more about me:

- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·Â I'm French and currently living in Brighton.
- ðŸ‘¶ My partner and I welcomed a little girl in Spring 2022.
- ðŸ§  We are raising our daughter bilingual. My partner is also currently learning french.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm a designer driving user experience conversations, mentoring others and trying to practice my craft whenever possible.

In this blog, I'm going to share my journey to motherhood, share stories, recommend products I found helpful and other bits. As people can experience motherhood differently and each baby is unique in their perfect ways, please note that my stories are related to my personal experience and might not be relevant to yours.

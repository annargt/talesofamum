When our baby was a little bit older than 6 months, we ditched the dummy and followed the Ferber method. This story is about our process and the results. In 4 days, we went from our baby waking up 2-3 times a night to her sleepling through the night (12-13h).

## How it started

After 6 months of interrupted sleep, we decided it might be time to look into sleep training (and probably get rid of the dummy at the same occasion).
At the time, our evening schedule roughly looked like this:

- 6-6.30 pm: Bed time routine + Breastfeed + in bed with the dummy
- 8-11pm: Baby would occasionally wake up, we would quickly put the dummy back, job done.
- 10-11pm: Breastfeed - either because she's woken up or doing it as a “dream feed”, hoping we'd get a few hours of extra sleep
- 2 am: Baby would often wake up and we'd just put the dummy back.
- 4 am: Baby would wake up but putting the dummy back isn't working. Awake for 30-40min with a need for comfort. I would often end up breastfeeding but sometimes a long cuddle would do the trick.
- 6-7 am: Waking up for good

I don't remember exactly when did we start thinking about sleep training, probably after a rough night.
My partner started ordering books on baby sleep, reading blog posts and it didn't take long for him to try to convince me to buy an online course for $250 (!).
Sure, the reviews of said-course were really good but I just couldn't get myself to pay that much money for it.
After digging up a bit, I found out on a forum that the course was actually following a similar method to the Ferber method. I was therefore convinced that it was the method to follow.

## Introducing Formula: the hope for a better sleep

As a first step, and after listening to the advice of other parents, we decided to introduce a bottle of formula before bed, in addition to breastfeeding.
Feeding has always been a swift operation for me (4-5min on each side) so I was initially worried that my supply would go down by effectively cutting 2 feeds.
As an experiment, I decided to combine both and to my surprise, our baby breastfed as usual that evening and then took 120ml of formula.
Night after night, the amount of Formula increased until it reached 210ml a night.

Introducing formula didn't do magic.
I did cut the 11 pm feed but our baby would still wake up for her dummy and comfort around twice a night.
At least I now knew that she wasn't waking up for food, so sleep training felt like the only solution.

## Ditching the dummy and starting the Ferber Method

And so one Thursday night, as our baby woke up at 4am, I just decided to try the Ferber method and removed the dummy at the same occasion, cold turkey.
My partner went to sleep in the spare room as he was working on Friday. This arrangement between us also meant that on Friday night, he could take the second night shift if needed.

### Night 1

Honestly? Awful. She screamed for 1h30 almost uninterrupted from 4 am.
I followed the timing recommended, holding to my phone like my life depended on it.
After each interval, I would go into her room, tell her that I was here, that I loved her so very much, leave, close the door and look desperatly at the timer on my phone, waiting for the next interval.
And then I would do it all over again. It was stressful.
Her screams were so loud that I googled if our neighbours could call the police for neglect. No joke.
I wore earplugs and they helped but it was still loud.
After 1h30 of her crying, I decided at 5.30 am that it was enough and it was basically "the morning anyway" so I breastfed her and put her back to bed.
After that she cried for another 10min and finally, fell asleep.

The following day, I was absolutely destroyed. I've had bad /short nights before but the screams just sucked the life out of me.
Our baby seemed completely fine although naps without the dummy were laborious. It was a tough day.

### Night 2

After feeding her at 6.30pm, she slightly cried for a few minutes and fell asleep quickly.
She essentially was exhausted from her day fighting naps. That night, my partner took over and I, for the very first time, slept in the spare room.

That night, I woke up at 4am to a silent house.
Feeling both surprised and worried of such quietness, it took me a while to actually fall back to sleep.
I then woke up at 7am, with a very wet t-shirt (if you know, you know), not hearing a single sound.

Turns out, she had woken up at 2am and cried on and off for about 45min.
Once back asleep, she slept through until 7 am. Wow, were we seeing progress already?

The following day was okay. My body was confused about all the sleep it got while baby was still fighting naps.
I also happened to bump into the neighbours and luckily they were very understanding which gave me some peace of mind at last.

### Night 3

That night, she cried for a total of 6 min. I kid you not, 6 min.
We fed her before bed and she woke up at 10.29pm for 6min. The next time she woke up? 6.58 am. We could not believe it.

### Night 4

The following nights, I kept thinking we were just in luck and there was no way we would get another full night.
I was just waiting for it.
But again, that night she woke up at 09.10pm for 3 min, and 10.06pm for 1min.
She then woke up at 6.10 am.
I breastfed her and put her back to bed (apparently you're not meant to do that from a nap-schedule perspective but at this point, this wasn't our focus).
After 20min of cooing, she fell back asleep for another 2 hours to finally wake up at 8.30am

### Night 5, 6, 7

The following nights followed a similar pattern.
A short awakening for 2-5min around 9pm and another one, often a bit longer around 5am.
Once back asleep, she would wake up between 6 and 7 am.
I would sometimes put her back to bed afterwards and she would either fall back asleep for an hour or less or entertain herself until we come and pick her up.

## Our new routine

Honestly, I still can't believe how effective this method was. I also completed forgot we once used dummies.
Our next goal is to look into improving our baby's naps but when it comes to the evening/night, here is our new routine:

- 6.30 - 7 pm: Bed time routine + Breastfeed + Bottle of formula
- 6-7.30 am: Waking up and starting the day

When we told people about the whole experience, the first reaction was always to tell us "how refreshed" we must feel after a full night.
The truth is that it took a bit more than a week for us to really appreciate it.
6 months having some broken sleep and now having full nights? I think our bodies simply felt jetlag during that week.

## Tips and Conclusion

Looking back, I'm glad we started on a Thursday.
It meant my partner and I could rely on each others without impact his work.
I'm also glad we ditched the dummy - I did find that it wasn't impossible to combine the dummy and a sleeping method but it just felt counterproductive at the time.
I must say this method has proven to be very effective for us but it's not for everyone.
You have to stick to your guns and it can be pretty stressful to hear your baby cry. High risk high reward they say?

If you're reading this, good luck. I do personally believe it's worth it.

In the spring of 2022, my partner and I welcomed our first child. At the time, we checked pretty much all the boxes to prepare us for the birth. We read books, attended in-person antenatal classes, created a thorough birth plan and practiced hypnobirthing techniques. We felt ready for the big day.

Now reflecting back, here are a few things we didn't know/ weren't told about / weren't ready for.

## No one told us about vomiting

I vomited 5 times during labour. 5. The first time, it freaked us out: what the heck was happening? When it comes to the unglamorous side of things, everyone talks about poop but no one told us about that. Turns out, this is what adrenaline can do to some people.

## Partners should have a support system in place

Giving birth is an intense experience and wether it's a smooth operation or one hell of a ride, the emotional load for partners shouldn't be neglected \*\*\*\*and can sometimes also be traumatic. Something to be aware of is that depending on the birth, there is a fairly good chance that mum and baby may have to stay one night or more in the hospital, leaving partners to often come home alone. My advice? Make sure someone is ready to come over if needed to talk things through, unload and process what just happened.

## C-sections aren't an “easy way out”

During our antenatal classes, I must say there were little focus on c-section deliveries and I've heard people refer to it as “the easy way”. I didn't experience one myself (nearly though - a story for another time) but I know a few people who did. There is a lot of things that I wasn’t aware of when it comes to it, such as the scar (how it looks, how it heals, how it feels, what can help) and the actual recovery process (and how doing too much too soon can play against you).

## Hospital shifts

To be fair, this isn't something you can prepare for and you might not be phased by it but when having a longer delivery, something I did not realise was that obviously, people working in the hospital have lives to come back to (doh!) so you care team might change throughout labour. This happened to us but luckily, we sticked with the same midwifes towards the end so we were able to bond with our care team which improved our experience.

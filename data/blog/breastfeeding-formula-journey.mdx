One of a few topics capable of creating great passion and divide depending on who you're talking to is breastfeeding.
Some women love it, some don't, some would like to, but can't.
And then you have the people who don't breastfeed but have a very clear and loud point of view on what you should be doing and why.

Before giving birth, I didn't have a strong view on whether or not I wanted to breastfeed.
I thought I would give it a go but no pressure, if it didn't work I knew plenty of healthy babies who grew up exclusively on formula.
So I decided not purchase any feeding equipment.

## The first few days

When my baby was born, we ended up spending 4-5 days in the hospital.
During that time, I expressed my wish to try and breastfeed so the midwives helped me find the best positions and showed me how to use a pump.
I also agreed for my baby to be given formula while everything was getting up and running.

Depending on the midwives, there was definitely more or less pressure to breastfeed.
Some would tell me to come and breastfeed during the night (knowing I was recovering 2 floors below and didn't have easy access), where others would tell me to rest, heal and come in the morning.

After a couple of days, my baby would latch for 5 min.
Again, some midwives would tell me it was good enough, others not long enough.
As it happened, I have a quick letdown so my baby never latched for long.
Her average feed until now (6 months later) has been between 6 and 8 min despite her growth being in the higher percentile.

I knew things would be different once at home, but I didn't expect that first night to be so horrible.
For some reason, my baby wasn't latching properly making it super painful.
I cried the whole night, applying [Lanolin cream](https://amzn.to/3XaBnCv) while telling my partner I couldn't continue like this.

## To breastfeed or not to breastfeed

The next day, we were due a visit from the health visitor.
After a terrible first night, I was dreading for her to come and tell me to persevere on breastfeeding.
I heard so many stories of mums being pushed to continue breastfeeding at all costs and left feeling unheard.
So when that woman in her early 60s knocked on my door at one of my most vulnerable moments, I made sure everyone (my partner and mother-in-law who was there) was briefed to fight in my corner.

And then, it happened.
She said the one thing that I didn't know I needed to hear: “the best option for your baby is for you to be able to take care of your baby”.  
These words were simple but it made a huge difference. It meant that I didn't have to feel guilty to feel the way I did, that I could switch to formula to focus on my recovery if I wanted to and that if eventually I did wish to breastfeed, I could also try again later on.

A weight immediately came off my shoulders.
I felt like a plan B could easily be set in motion and later that morning, my partner went and bought formula, bottles and a microwave.
Since my wish was to give breastfeeding another go, our health visitor offered to watch me breastfeeding to see if she could help with positioning.
While doing so, she suggested a simple change: pressing the boob at a different angle (a “U” instead of a “C”). This somehow magically improved the latch and without sugarcoating it, breastfeeding became immediately less, then not painful at all.
Equipped with my new technique and feeling reassured by our plan B, I continued breastfeeding knowing I could stop if I wanted to.

## Breastfeeding: 6 months later

After that health visitor visit, I actually breastfed pain-free and ended up not using the bottles and formula until much later on.
I did not plan on breastfeeding for that long (and still going) but it did prove itself to be extremely practical (no need to plan, you've got all you need) and a precious bonding time with my baby.

I ended up introducing formula at around 6 months of age for the night feeds (in addition to breastfeeding) and to prepare her porridge in the morning.

## Feeding equipment: what I ended up buying and found useful

As I was breastfeeding on-demand and I had a good supply, the first items I bought were:

- A [Haakaa pump](https://amzn.to/3GoQLWa) to regulate my flow and slowly create a small stash of milk in my freezer.
  I found this useful the first 4-5 months, up until I started breastfeeding from both sides at once.
  What I liked about it is that there is nothing to do really: you plug it and the milk naturally flows while your baby feeds on the other side.
  It's also cheap, doesn't need much storage, is easy to clean and helpful if you get a clogged duct.
- [Freezer bags](https://amzn.to/3GmrtaY) to store the milk.
- [Anti-colic Bottles](https://amzn.to/3GmrtaY): We used a few bottles using my frozen milk after a couple of months, mainly to make sure she would accept bottles later on or for the odd appointment where I wouldn’t be around.
- [Different sizes of teats](https://amzn.to/3AmSGGE) for the bottles. I didn't even know that existed until quite late.
  I found out about teats size when we started using formula for the last feed before bed.
  Our baby was getting impatient with the size 1 so I switched to size 2.
  I eventually upgraded to the size 3 after our baby got a cold as she started bitting on the bottle teat.
  As she had a sore throat, I changed the teat to see if it would make a difference and it did and we continued with size 3 ever since.
- [Microwave Steriliser bags](https://amzn.to/3GjGmuJ) - just super practical
- I did buy a [medela manual pump](https://amzn.to/3gdkPcp) but ended up using it only a few times.
  I found that it worked on and off, it didn't seem to work on one side and ended up being a lot of faff.
- 4x [nursing sleep bras](https://www.jojomamanbebe.co.uk/2-pack-maternity-nursing-sleep-bras-a9252.html): easy and comfortable but quite covering (not ideal if wearing a top with a bit of front or back cleavage).
  If you try a bra before birth, just be aware that your rib cage is somewhat larger when pregnant and will be smaller again after birth so if a bra feels tight, you don't necessarily have to size up.
  If you can, I'd recommend getting a fitting session from the brand you're buying from.
- 2x [calvin klein bras](https://www.calvinklein.co.uk/maternity-bra-modern-cotton-000qf6218e001): I got them on sales and they are my favorites: super comfortable and with slim straps which is great when wearing dresses or lighter style of clothing
- 4x large muslins: When feeding outside, I'd just tie one corner of the muslin to my bra and cover me and the baby with it.
- 2x small muslins: [these are my absolute favourites](https://thegreenmumma.com/collections/muslins/products/pom-pom-shoulder-muslin) when needing to quickly clean my baby's face.
  They are cute, super soft and high quality muslin squares. After 6 months, I still use them every day.

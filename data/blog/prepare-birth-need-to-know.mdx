In the spring of 2022, my partner and I welcomed our first child.
At the time, we checked pretty much all the boxes to prepare us for the birth.
We read books, attended in-person antenatal classes, created a thorough birth plan and practised hypnobirthing techniques.
We felt ready for the big day.

Now reflecting back, there are a few things we didn't know:

## Hospital shifts

To be fair, this isn't something you can prepare for and you might not be phased by it.
When having a longer delivery, something I did not realise was that obviously, people working in the hospital have lives to come back to (doh!) so your care team might change during labour.
This happened to us but luckily, we stuck with the same midwives for most of the active labour and delivery.
I believe this made a big difference as it means we were all on the same page and we were able to bond with our care team.

## No one told us about vomiting

I vomited 5 times during labour. 5.
The first time, it freaked us out: what the heck was happening?
When it comes to the unglamorous side of things, everyone talks about what can eventually come out as you push (if you know, you know) but not a word on being sick.
Turns out, this is what adrenaline can do to some people.

## Support system for partners

Whether it's a smooth operation or one hell of a ride, giving birth will emotionally impact partners to some level and can occasionally feel traumatic.
Something to be aware of is that it's not uncommon for partners to go home alone on Day 1 as mum and baby may have to stay one night or more in the hospital.
My advice? Make sure someone is ready to come over if needed to talk things through, unload and process what just happened.

## C-sections aren't an “easy way out”

During our antenatal classes, I must say there was very little focus on c-section deliveries.
My perception of it was that it looked like a routine operation (so many women having it right? Nope!) and I've heard people refer to it as “the easy way”.
Now, I didn't experience one myself (nearly though - a story for another time) but I know a few people who did.
There are a lot of things that I wasn't aware of when it comes to it which I think are important to research if this is something for you.
First of all, the operation cuts through 7 layers of skin (it's a major surgery) and people heal differently.
Postpartum, the main topics I've heard from women that had a c-section were: the scar (how it looks, how it heals, how it feels, what can help) and the actual recovery process (and how doing too much too soon can play against you).
When it comes to the recovery, one thing I can say is that despite a difficult V-birth, my recovery was probably twice shorter than the ones having c-sections and fairly straightforward.

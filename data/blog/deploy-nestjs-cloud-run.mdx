## Prerequisites

- Your Nest project is a Github repository. This allows us to setup continuous deployment with Github Actions. The code for this tutorial is available [here]().
- Docker installed on your machine
- A project setup in Google Cloud Platform

## Start a NestJS project

Incase you don't have a NestJS project setup already, set one up with the Nest CLI:

```shell
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

Follow the prompts to setup your project.  

### Configure a PORT environment variable

Cloud Run will automatically inject the `PORT` number, so you'll need to edit the default bootstrap function which starts the server.

Here's the default:

```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
```

You'll need to update this to the following:

```ts

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 3000);
}
```

Now locally if you don't have a port variable set in your env file, it will default to 3000. 

If, however, you try testing this locally by using a custom `PORT` environment variable and starting up your local server, you'll notice it doesn't work.

That's because in order to use environment variables in NestJS you need to make the `.env` file accessible.

To do that "the Nest way", install the required dependency:

```shell
npm i --save @nestjs/config
```

Then use the package in the root `AppModule`:

```ts:app.module.ts
...
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can now set a custom `PORT` value in your env file and test it locally to check that it's working.

Cloud Run will take care of the port for you on production, so you don't need to manually set a `PORT` env variable in your Cloud Run secrets.

## Prepare the Docker image

In order to deploy to Cloud Run, you need a container image. 

A container image is an isolated package of software that includes everything you need to run the code. You can define container images by writing a `Dockerfile` which provides the instructions on how to build the image.

Let's add the Dockerfile now:

```shell
touch Dockerfile
```

And then let's add the instructions to the Dockerfile. See the comments which explain each step:

```Dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Base image
FROM node:18

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Creates a "dist" folder with the production build
RUN npm run build

# Start the server using the production build
CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js" ]
```

Similar to a `.gitignore` file, we can add a `.dockerignore` file which will prevent certain files from being included in the image build.

```shell
touch .dockerignore
```

Then exclude the following files from the image build:

```:.dockerignore
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
```

### Test the container locally

Before pushing this up to Cloud Run, let's now do some testing locally to check if the Dockerfile behaves as we expect. 

Let's first build the image using the command in your terminal at the root of your project (you can swap out `nest-cloud-run` with your project name). Don't forget the `.`!

```shell
docker build -t nest-cloud-run .
```

You can verify the image has been created by running `docker images` which will output a list of Docker images you have on your local machine:

```shell
docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
nest-cloud-run               latest    004f7f222139   31 seconds ago   1.24GB
```

Let's now start the container and run the image with this command (be sure to same image name used above):

```shell
docker run -p80:3000 nest-cloud-run
```

This should open up a containerized image of your app via a localhost port. If it doesn't, you might have something running locally on port `8080` or it might be another issue on your machine. You might need to do a bit of stack overflowing if you run into trouble here!

- running `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)` to clear your current open containers
- run `docker builder prune` to clear your image cache


### Optimize Dockerfile for production

One of the ways you're charged using Cloud Run is by the size of the image - the smaller the image size the better.

Now that we've confirmed the image is working locally, let's try to reduce the size of the image.

Running the command like we did above gives us our image size:

```shell
docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
nest-cloud-run               latest    004f7f222139   31 seconds ago   1.24GB
```

1.24GB is pretty big! Let's dive back into our `Dockerfile` and make some optimizations.

- It's [recommended](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) to use the Alpine node images when trying to optimize for image size. Using `node:18-alpine` instead of `node:18` by itself reduces the image size from 1.24GB to 466MB!
